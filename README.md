# 🛡️ IRIS Protocol

**Your AI-Powered DeFi Insurance Agent.**  
Built on **Solana**, powered by **AI**, and designed to protect your crypto portfolio — before it’s too late.

## 🚀 What is IRIS?

**IRIS Protocol** is an automated risk management layer for DeFi users.  
It continuously monitors your wallet using a real-time AI model trained on DeFi volatility patterns. When risks are detected, IRIS takes **instant protective action** — swapping risky assets, triggering NFT-based insurance, and sending alerts.

> “Don’t just insure your assets. Outsmart the crash.”
